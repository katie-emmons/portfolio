The ability to selectively attend to one talker in the presence of competing talkers is a crucial skill employed in everyday life. In this study, multitalker speech perception thresholds were measured in three groups; Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder (FASD), and
an age- and sex-matched typically functioning (TF) group. Participants listened to three simultaneous sentences from the Coordinate Response Measure corpus: the target stream to be attended (0 azimuth) and two spatially
separated (645 azimuth) masker streams. Participants were asked to identify the color and number associated with the callsign “Charlie.” Target-tomasker ratios (TMRs) were estimated based on the average of four runs in
which the target was fixed at 40 dB SPL and maskers were adaptively varied
using a one-up-one-down procedure to estimate 50% correct. The target
speaker was always male; the two maskers were either male/male or female/
female. Overall, TMR thresholds were higher in both ASD and FASD
groups than the TF group. Additionally, a negative correlation between
intellectual ability and TMR thresholds was observed. These preliminary
results suggest intellectual ability may impact how well listener’s perceive
speech in multitalker situations, especially in neurodiverse populations.
